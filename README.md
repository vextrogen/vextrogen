**Hi there, I'm Luna. I'm a BSc (Hons) Computer Science Graduate of the University of Reading**

I'm 23 years old and from the UK. My pronouns are she/her

My development experience includes work with Discord bots using JavaScript/NodeJS, as well as applications and projects written in C/C++/C#, Java, Python and HTML/CSS.
That being said, I have an interest in many other forms of development/computer science, such as Cyber Security and UI/UX design. My Dissertation topic was in creating a
Facial Recognition application in Python, as well as research into the technical and ethical aspects of such technology.
